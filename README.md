# Toolpip-plugin
This is my first plugin written for my portfolio.
When writing this code, I learned how to work with encapsulation, OPP, and understood the principle of creating plug-ins.

Tooltips can be attached to any HTML element. When you hover the element with your mouse, the title attribute is displayed in a little box next to the element, just like a native tooltip.
 Not recommended for commercial projects
